Read and follow these rules:
- `~/.claude/crafter/rules/update-check.md`

Read `.planning/STATE.md` and display its full contents.

Then provide a brief, conversational summary covering:

- What is currently being worked on
- What was recently completed
- What is coming up next
- Any known issues or blockers worth flagging

Keep the summary concise — a few sentences is enough. The full STATE.md content already provides the detail.
