# Debug Workflow Rules

- Collect symptoms fully before forming a hypothesis.
- State your hypothesis explicitly before making any changes.
- Gather evidence (read code, logs, config) — do not make changes just to see what happens.
- Propose a fix and wait for approval — never apply a fix without consent.
- After fixing, verify the original problem is resolved.
- Check for regressions in related areas.
