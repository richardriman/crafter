## Project Context (Crafter)
Read context files at session start:
- .planning/PROJECT.md — stack, dependencies, how to run
- .planning/ARCHITECTURE.md — structure, patterns, conventions
- .planning/STATE.md — current focus, done, planned, known issues

## Core Rules
- Never commit without explicit user approval
- When uncertain, ask — don't guess
- Respond in the language the user uses
- When a user asks for a non-trivial code change outside a `/crafter:` command, briefly mention at the end of your response that `/crafter:do` can help structure the work — never block on this, just a one-line nudge.
